# Implementation plan

## Phase 0 repo and docs — done
- [x] Inspect existing repository and remote; preserve existing README.md.
- [x] Read available schema and prior fully-read UC context; record missing originals.
- [x] Add ignore rules, environment template, AGENTS.md and setup documentation.
- [x] Create buildable module bootstrap so every commit builds.
- [x] Push phase commits (verified before Phase 4).
Decision: repository already initialized on main; README.md is untouched. Module and empty entrypoints are bootstrapped in phase 0 to satisfy build-at-every-commit. Problem: original UC Word attachment is missing; no sequence attachment is currently available. Phase push pending verification.

## Phase 1 project skeleton — done
- [x] Feature-oriented structure, API and worker entrypoints.
- [x] Config, structured logging, request ID/recovery/timeout/CORS.
- [x] Consistent JSON errors, graceful shutdown and GET /health.
- [x] Build, vet and HTTP/config tests.
- [x] Push phase commits (verified before Phase 4).
Decision: standard library env config/slog; chi/cors allowlist; middleware timeout produces JSON. Push blocked pending explicit remote confirmation requested by automatic approval review. Phase 0 local commits completed; remote is origin/main at Yoshi4489/SA-Lathe-Shop-BE.

## Phase 2 DB migrations and Docker — done
- [x] PostgreSQL pool and DB readiness endpoint.
- [x] golang-migrate and empty initial up/down migration.
- [x] API/worker Dockerfiles, PostgreSQL/private S3 Compose, PowerShell tasks.
- [x] Verify build/vet/tests/lint/API/DB, migrate up/down and container entrypoints.
- [x] Local batch commits; stop before auth/UC feature code.
- [x] Phase push: completed to the confirmed organization repository before Phase 4.
Decision: pgx/v5 in repository only; standard library config/slog/validation; golang-migrate v4.19.0 pinned CLI. Local S3 switched to digest-pinned official SeaweedFS after MinIO registry denial. Official Go/Alpine ECR mirrors resolved Docker Hub timeouts. Verified liveness/readiness 200, DB-down readiness 503 with liveness 200, anonymous S3 listing 403, up/down/up migrations and graceful API/worker stop. Temporary verification containers and newly-created volumes were removed; no existing project files/data deleted. No secrets persisted or committed. See docs/VERIFICATION.md.

## Phase 3 auth and roles — done
- [x] Staff schema, Argon2id passwords, opaque revocable sessions and RBAC.
- [x] One-time first-Admin CLI with hidden password prompt; no default account.
- [x] Admin creates/lists/edits/deactivates/reactivates Workers; no role promotion.
- [x] Login/logout/me endpoints; expiry and DB-backed activity/revocation checks.
- [x] Service mock tests, HTTP tests and real PostgreSQL integration/race checks.
- [x] Build/vet/tests/lint, migrations up/down/up and Docker auth verified.
- [x] Update runbook and local 3-8-file buildable commit batches.
- [x] Customer login was an open question at Phase 3 completion, resolved in Phase 4; suppliers have no login.
- [x] Push phase batches: completed before Phase 4.
Decision: Argon2id 64 MiB/3 passes/2 lanes; random 256-bit Bearer tokens, SHA-256 token digests only in PostgreSQL, configurable absolute TTL (default 12h). Login and Worker credential/activity changes serialize on the account row. Deactivation/password/username changes revoke sessions atomically; already-running requests may finish, subsequent requests reauthenticate. No session cache. Local login abuse limiter is bounded and trusts only the socket IP. See docs/AUTH.md and docs/AUTH_VERIFICATION.md. Phase 4 remains unapproved; current missing original UC/sequence files and customer authorization must be resolved before UC1 work.

## Phase 4 UC1 submit job request — done
- [x] Owner authorized Phase 4 on develop on 2026-10-14; working tree inspected and clean.
- [x] Read docs/01-backend.md, requirements baseline, attached ER schema and existing auth contracts.
- [x] Record owner decisions: customer login required; sixth rejection cancels; Deposit/PO deadline is acceptance plus 14 days; private object keys and metadata only.
- [x] Confirm customer account provisioning and company account cardinality: self-registration; multiple users per company.
- [x] Confirm upload categories (documents/images) and notification channels (LINE/in-system).
- [x] Implement UC1 request domain/service, mock tests and authenticated routes.
- [x] Confirm exact file allowlist, invitation-only company access, and LINE Admin user target.
- [x] Customer accounts and ownership authorization, without weakening staff sessions.
- [x] Request validation, private signed uploads/downloads, content checks and transactional outbox.
- [x] Per-user inbox and separate outbox worker, LINE Admin-only push with stable retry keys.
- [x] Mock/unit/HTTP and real PostgreSQL/S3 integration, staff regression, migration down/up and Docker checks.
- [x] Update runbook and verification documentation.
- [x] Create nine logical 3-8-file commits; independently build each exact commit tree.
- [x] Push completed implementation to develop only; remote 451a0e8 verified on 2026-10-15, main unchanged at 86d5be1.
Decision: customer self-registration, owner-issued one-use company invitations and company-shared request reads. Input follows ER: selected customer ID verified against membership, description, positive int64 qty, material_spec and optional future requested deadline. Text bounds 10,000/2,000 Unicode characters; no artificial quantity business cap. Final evidence uses distinct private keys and ETag-conditional copy after inspection. Requests/outbox and inbox/acknowledgement are atomic; LINE targets only the configured Admin user and is disabled by default. Real LINE messages were not sent. See docs/UC1.md and docs/UC1_VERIFICATION.md. Original detailed UC/sequence files remain unavailable; reviewed guide, ER and owner decisions cover this phase. Stop before UC2.
## Phase 5 UC2 estimate and quote — in progress
- [x] Owner authorized the next phase on develop on 2026-10-15; clean branch and current workflow rules reviewed.
- [x] Read the backend guide and requirements; identify quotation transaction/status rules and unresolved pricing basis.
- [x] Confirm 60% total-cost markup, whole-request totals and upward satang rounding.
- [x] Exact money domain and pricing unit tests, no float arithmetic or VAT.
- [x] Implement quotation/revision/cost schema and transactional repository with row locks; real DB verification pending.
- [x] Worker draft/edit/send and request rejection with reason; restrict customer reads to their company and hide internal cost breakdowns.
- [x] Handler validation, errors, API wiring and unit HTTP checks; real auth/DB flow pending.
- [ ] Full regression, disposable PostgreSQL integration, migration/Docker checks and API runbook.
- [ ] Logical buildable commits during work; update plan and verify end-of-phase push to develop only.
Decision: minimum price = (material+labor)*1.60 for the entire quantity, rounded upward to a satang. Exact decimal strings/NUMERIC(18,2), no VAT. Scope and commits are in docs/UC2_PLAN.md; API in docs/UC2.md. Build/unit checks pass, but Docker startup fails on its dockerInference socket before the engine is available. Real PostgreSQL/concurrency/migration/S3/Docker checks are pending; see docs/UC2_VERIFICATION.md. Do not reset Docker/delete its data without authorization. Phase 5 is NOT complete and has not been pushed. No UC3 customer decisions, rejection threshold handling, deposits, PO or job opening are implemented; the 14-day clock remains acceptance-based in a later phase.
## Phase 6 UC3 verify customer terms — todo
- [ ] Accept/reject history, revisions, rejection threshold and pricing policy.
## Phase 7 UC4 deposit and company PO — todo
- [ ] Validate first payment and company PO, open job only when terms fulfilled.
## Phase 8 UC5 stock check and reservation — todo
- [ ] Required materials, partial reservations, shortages and row locking.
## Phase 9 UC6 order materials — todo
- [ ] Supplier orders/items and supplier rejection flow.
## Phase 10 UC7 receive and stock — todo
- [ ] Partial receipts, damage claims, moving average and supplier settlement.
## Phase 11 UC8 execute job — todo
- [ ] Stock issue, unused reservation reconciliation, photos and actual cost/time.
## Phase 12 UC9 deliver and settle — todo
- [ ] Self/third-party delivery, invoices, post-completion payments and returns.

Every future phase: follow the mandatory AGENTS.md commit/push policy and docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md. Commit focused buildable groups as work progresses, with clear purpose and relevant tests; never one giant phase commit. Update this plan, run full checks, review status/log and push each completed phase to the authorized branch, verifying the remote tip. Record blockers instead of silently leaving a finished phase unpushed. Current authorization is Phase 5 on develop only; UC3-UC9 remain unapproved. Historical push-pending notes in Phases 0-3 were resolved by verified pushes to the new organization repository before Phase 4. Customer joining/access rules are confirmed and implemented.
